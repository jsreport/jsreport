This happens with the `JIS_C6226-1983`, `JIS_X0212-1990`, `HZ-GB-2312`, `JOHAB`, the ISO-2022 family and the EBCDIC family.\\n\\n**Note:** ASCII-incompatible encodings are those that don't map the 8-bit code points `0x20` to `0x7E` to the `0x0020` to `0x007E` Unicode code points)\\n\\n*   Authors **must not** use `CESU-8`, `UTF-7`, `BOCU-1` and/or `SCSU` as [cross-site scripting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cross-site_scripting) attacks with these encodings have been demonstrated.\\n*   Authors should not use `UTF-32` because not all HTML5 encoding algorithms can distinguish it from `UTF-16`.\\n\\n**Notes:**\\n\\n*   The declared character encoding must match the one the page was saved with to avoid garbled characters and security holes.\\n*   The [`<meta>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta \\\"The HTML <meta> element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like <base>, <link>, <script>, <style> or <title>.\\\") element declaring the encoding must be inside the [`<head>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head \\\"The HTML <head> element provides general information (metadata) about the document, including its title and links to its scripts and style sheets.\\\") element and **within the first 1024 bytes** of the HTML as some browsers only look at those bytes before choosing an encoding.\\n*   This [`<meta>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta \\\"The HTML <meta> element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like <base>, <link>, <script>, <style> or <title>.\\\") element is only one part of the [algorithm to determine a page's character set](https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/parsing.html#encoding-sniffing-algorithm \\\"Algorithm charset page\\\").

User agents use the current source size to select one of the sources supplied by the `srcset` attribute, when those sources are described using width ('`w`') descriptors. The selected source size affects the intrinsic size of the image (the image’s display size if no CSS styling is applied). If the `srcset` attribute is absent, or contains no values with a width (`w`) descriptor, then the `sizes` attribute has no effect.\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"references\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"MDN Reference\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"iframe\",\n            \"description\": {\n                \"kind\": \"markdown\",\n                \"value\": \"The iframe element represents a nested browsing context.\"\n            },\n            \"attributes\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"src\",\n                    \"description\": {\n                        \"kind\": \"markdown\",\n                        \"value\": \"The URL of the page to embed.

The value of this attribute will be in one of the following categories:\\n\\n*   **Omitted or a JavaScript MIME type:** For HTML5-compliant browsers this indicates the script is JavaScript. HTML5 specification urges authors to omit the attribute rather than provide a redundant MIME type. In earlier browsers, this identified the scripting language of the embedded or imported (via the `src` attribute) code. JavaScript MIME types are [listed in the specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types#JavaScript_types).\\n*   **`module`:** For HTML5-compliant browsers the code is treated as a JavaScript module. The processing of the script contents is not affected by the `charset` and `defer` attributes. For information on using `module`, see [ES6 in Depth: Modules](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/08/es6-in-depth-modules/). Code may behave differently when the `module` keyword is used.\\n*   **Any other value:** The embedded content is treated as a data block which won't be processed by the browser. Developers must use a valid MIME type that is not a JavaScript MIME type to denote data blocks. The `src` attribute will be ignored.\\n\\n**Note:** in Firefox you could specify the version of JavaScript contained in a `<script>` element by including a non-standard `version` parameter inside the `type` attribute — for example `type=\\\"text/javascript;version=1.8\\\"`.
