**Utils for developing jsreport studio extensions**

## jsreport-studio-start
`jsreport-studio-start` starts the jsreport studio in the development mode with hot reloading used for developing custom extensions.

## jsreport-studio-build

`jsreport-studio-build` command should be run from the main extension directory. It automatically locates `studio/main_dev.js` and build it. The most common approach is to run it from the `package.json`  `prepublish` script. It's also recommended to additionally install and use [in-publish](https://github.com/iarna/in-publish) module to assure the `jsreport-studio-build` does run only during npm publish.

```js
"scripts": {
    "prepublish": "in-publish && jsreport-studio-build || not-in-publish"
}
```
