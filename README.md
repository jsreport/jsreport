*An open-source platform for designing and rendering various reports.*

jsreport is a reporting server letting developers define reports using javascript templating engines like handlebars. It supports various report output formats like html, pdf, excel, docx, and others.  It also includes advanced reporting features like user management, REST API, scheduling, designer, or sending emails.

You can find more information on the official project website https://jsreport.net

## Installation

Basic installation from the npm
```sh            
npm install -g @jsreport/jsreport-cli
jsreport init
jsreport configure
jsreport start
```

You can also download compiled binary or pull from the official docker images. See [https://jsreport.net/on-prem](http://jsreport.net/on-prem) for the details.

## Documentation

See the [https://jsreport.net/learn](https://jsreport.net/learn) for an overview of concepts, guides, clients, and general documentation.

## Extensions
The jsreport official distribution in npm, docker, or compiled binary includes the most commonly used extensions. However, the list of available extensions is much longer, and you may want to install some of the missing ones as well.  See the list of available packages [here](https://github.com/jsreport/jsreport/tree/master/packages) or in the [documentation](https://jsreport.net/learn).

You are also not limited to extensions we provide to you. You can implement your extensions. See the [Implementing custom extension](https://jsreport.net/learn/custom-extension) article.

## Node.js

You can find documentation for adapting this jsreport distribution using nodejs and also information for integrating it into an existing nodejs application in the article [adapting jsreport](https://jsreport.net/learn/adapting-jsreport).

The official jsreport distribution wires the most popular extensions into the ready-to-use package.
However, if you are skilled, you are free to start from the ground using [jsreport-core](https://github.com/jsreport/jsreport/tree/master/packages/jsreport-core).

## Development
We use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to manage the monorepo. The basic workflow is the following
```sh
git clone https://github.com/jsreport/jsreport
yarn install
yarn start
```
The tests for the individual package runs the following way

```
yarn workspace @jsreport/jsreport-scripts test
```

The studio extensions development with the hot reload can be started using
```
set NODE_ENV=jsreport-development&&yarn start
```

## Roadmap
- adding more features to docx/pptx/xlsx recipes
- pdf compression
- version control extension direct git integration and improvements
- studio editor intellisense
- html-to-xlsx - images, filters...

More in the [backlog](https://github.com/jsreport/jsreport/issues).

## Vulnerabilities

We update vulnerable jsreport dependencies based on npm and Snyk audits during every release. Please wait until we release the next version when you notice a security warning in your audit. There is no need to create a ticket for it. In case you see a direct impact on jsreport security that you can replicate, please send us an email to support@jsreport.net and we will make sure it's fixed ASAP. Note there is no need to panic when there is a vulnerability mentioned in the audit because it is the most likely in the code path that is not used. A typical example of a vulnerability is an eventual DDoS attack through a dependency parsing some internal config, which in fact can't happen and isn't a vulnerability at all.
